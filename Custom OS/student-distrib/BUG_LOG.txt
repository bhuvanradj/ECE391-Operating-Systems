BUG_LOG:

Problem: Grep breaking RTC
Fix: Moved enable_rtc(2) to kernel entry, so rtc open won't reset the frequency

Problem: Fish not showing up on terminal 2 and 3
Fix: Was using memset 0 on vmem in change term, which set text color to black, changed to use clear() function instead.

Problem: Cursor not following text when multitasking is enabled
Fix: move_cursor must be linked to the active terminal, only allowed to be moved on keyboard press, or the task that called
putc is running in the active terminal

Problem: Fish not moving after switching from and back to a terminal
Fix: phys_base in remap_terminal remap_terminal_vidmap not bitshifted down properly

Problem: Exiting base shell on terminal 2 and 3 causes pagefaults
Fix: terminal 2 and 3's parent needs to be 0 (the kernel process), and use the exec_ebp saved when terminal 1 was first executed

Problem: Scheduling causes pagefaults
Fix: Scheduling flow was wrong. The scheduling interrupt handler was not changing task back to the "old" task, fixed by saving current_task_id in local variable "this_task", and when returning from the assembly linkage, restoring current_task to "this_task"

Problem: Terminal switching causing residue
Fix: Just moved some steps around and it works lol.

Problem: Keyboard not recieving input during syscall_read
Fix: Need STI in interrupt_common, interrupt gates cli by default

Problem: Pagefaulting after IRET in execute
Fix: ESP for IRET needs to be set to bottom of user page - 4, since processor will try to read a whole long(4 byte), and if esp is on bottom edge, it will leak into the next page

Problem: Triple faulting on reload_paging
Fix: Kernel page still needs to be written

Problem: Interrupts not working
Fix: irq masks are active low. inverted original mask and its working.

Problem: Triple faulting on interrupt
Fix: status bits in idt_entries need to be set

Problem: Faulting whenever we attempt to initialize paging/set the page directory
Fix: set the correct bit in cr4 before setting the necessary bits in cr3

Problem: PIC Initialization code causing triple fault
Fix: Use cli() and sti() function calls to manage simple critical sections

Problem: PIC EOI are not being recieved properly
Fix: EOI should be sent twice when in a master and slave cascade
